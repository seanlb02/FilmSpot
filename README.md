## App Overview 

FilmSpot is a program where users can search and find films listed on IMBDs top 1000 movies of all time database. Users can create a profile, add movies from the database to their own 'my favourites' folder then retrieve film reccommendations based on these favourites. An additional feature is FilmSpot Trivia, a component of the app where users can test their Hollywood knowledge and discover great films in the process.

Work was completed within a Kanban agile framework via Trello.
